## 🔍 What is UPI?

Unified Payments Interface (UPI) is a real-time payment system developed by the **National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI)** that facilitates inter-bank transactions via mobile platforms. It allows users to send or receive money instantly using a UPI ID, without needing bank account details.

- Launched in **2016**
- Processes over **10+ billion transactions per month** *(as of 2024)*
- Powers apps like **Google Pay, PhonePe, Paytm, BHIM, Amazon Pay**, etc.

## 🚀 Why I Selected This Project

The UPI ecosystem is one of the fastest-growing digital payment systems globally, but there's **no single source of truth** for performance metrics across all banks. Most data is scattered, semi-structured, and hidden in HTML tables or PDFs.

This project was an opportunity to:
- Solve a **real-world data collection** problem using scraping.
- **Analyze and compare** bank performance in terms of volume, success rates, and market share.
- Build a **clean dashboard-style application** using Streamlit and SQL.

## 📈 Growth of UPI

- In 2017, UPI handled around **100 million transactions per month**.
- By 2024, it crossed **10 billion monthly transactions**.
- Over **300 banks** are part of the UPI ecosystem.
- Rapid growth driven by:
  - Smartphone penetration
  - Government push for digital payments
  - Rise of fintech apps
  - Seamless integration across platforms
